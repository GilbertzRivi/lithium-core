# lithium_core: audit and grant guide

This is the entry point for auditing `lithium_core` as a 
standalone cryptography and key-management library, and the 
reading order for the grant review. The library is the subject; 
the wider Lithium messenger is only context that shows it isn't 
built in a vacuum.

## Scope

The subject is the `lithium_core` library, not the whole 
messenger. The boundary is set by 
[`threat-model.md`](threat-model.md): what the library guarantees 
and what is the caller's job (authenticity of the recipient's 
public keys, unique domain-separation labels, replay protection, 
transport). The central piece is the hybrid KyberBox combiner, and 
its correctness is the main finding.

**In scope:** the two pillars of `lithium_core`, key management at 
rest (`keys`, `secrets`, `public`) and hybrid encryption (`crypto`, 
`hpke`), plus the helpers (`opaque`, `pow`, `passwords`, 
`utils::store`).

**Out of scope:** the application layers, `lithiumd` (IPC, E2E 
session), `lithiums` (relay, REST transport, rate limiting), 
`lithiumg` (GUI). The library is consumed by them; they describe 
the usage contract the messenger follows and the library assumes, 
but they are not the target of the audit.

## Reading order

1. [`threat-model.md`](threat-model.md): the audit boundary, 
   guarantees vs the caller's responsibility.
2. [`combiner.md`](combiner.md): the central deliverable, the 
   combiner construction, the mapping onto X-Wing and the 
   UniversalCombiner, and what the audit confirms.
3. [`kyberbox.md`](kyberbox.md): the full wire and key flow of 
   KyberBox and the detailed construction-level risks (the "Open 
   risks and questions for the auditor" section).
4. [`key-hierarchy.md`](key-hierarchy.md): the at-rest key catalog 
   (MK, KEK, DEK, `.keyf`, the MkProvider, rotation).
5. [`reference.md`](reference.md): the API module by module; plus 
   the crate `README.md` and rustdoc (`cargo doc -p lithium_core`).

## Central questions

What the audit confirms (see [`combiner.md`](combiner.md)): that 
`base_key` is the UniversalCombiner instance it claims to be (the 
dualPRF combiner with `ss_kem` as salt and `ecdh_key` as IKM, the 
full transcript bound into `info`), that HKDF-Extract covers the 
non-uniform X25519 IKM, and that the serialization and domain 
separation are implemented faithfully.

## Reproducibility and coverage

- Dependencies are pinned in `Cargo.lock`; the toolchain is pinned 
  in `rust-toolchain.toml` (`1.96.0`). The full bit-for-bit 
  reproducibility of the messenger client binary is documented in 
  the main Lithium repo.
- Known-answer vectors (KAT): `tests/golden_tests.rs` (6 tests) on 
  data in `tests/testdata/` (`kyberbox_golden_v1`, 
  `mldsa87_verify_golden_v1`, `hpke_golden_v1`).
- Public API tests: `crypto_tests` (86), `hpke_tests` (37), 
  `secret_tests` (66), `password_tests` (21), `store_tests` (14).
- Fuzzing: 10 `cargo-fuzz` targets on the surfaces that parse 
  untrusted input (`keyfile_parse`, `secret_json`, `opaque_parse`, 
  `kyberbox_decrypt`, `aead_decrypt`, `sign_verify`, `pow_verify`, 
  `hpke_open`, `hpke_setup_receiver`, `hpke_wire`).

## What the auditor gets

- The crate source: `lithium_core/src/`.
- This dossier, self-contained under `lithium_core/docs/`.
- The combiner mapping onto the literature (in `combiner.md`) and 
  the implementation points the audit confirms.
